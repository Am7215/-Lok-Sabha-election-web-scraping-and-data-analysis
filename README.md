Introduction

Hi everyone! This repository contains the code I wrote to scrape election data from the Election Commission of India (ECI) website (https://results.eci.gov.in).

Project Goals

My goal was to extract information about candidates, their party affiliations, and vote counts for [specific election(s) you're interested in]. This data can be used for various purposes, such as:

Analyzing voting trends
Creating visualizations of election results
Building applications or tools based on the data
